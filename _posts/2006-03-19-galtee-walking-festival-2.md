TARG are participating in the [Galtee Walking Festival](http://www.aherlow.com/html/walking_festival.html) hosted by the [Glen of Aherlow Fáilte Society](http://www.aherlow.com/html/home.html) over the weekend of March 31st - 2nd April. We plan to provide voice communinications for all walks, and also hope to experiment with the usefulness of the Amateur Packet Reporting System (APRS) in this type of event. Anyone who thinks they may be of assistance please contact John, EI7IG at +353-86-8167310.
