 Front row: EI2JB, EI2HI, EI3ENB, EI3FFB\[/caption\] At our recently held March meeting, Oliver, ON4EI/EI8GQB dropped in to say hi. He outlined to the group some of is preparatory work in advance of [CQ WW WPX SSB Contest](https://web.archive.org/web/20150827092454/http://www.cqwpx.com/). Fingers crossed he does as well this time as he did last year. The meeting continued quite late into the evening with lots being discussed.
