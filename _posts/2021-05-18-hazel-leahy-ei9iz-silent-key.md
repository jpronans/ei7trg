It is with great sadness that we announce the death of Hazel Leahy EI9IZ of Barnlough, Bansha, Co Tipperary who passed away on Thursday the 13th of May 2021. While not very active in recent years.

Hazel was one of the founding members of Tipperary Amateur Radio Group when it was formed in October 1994. She served as secretary of T.A.R.G. on its formation and played a major role in getting the group active over the following years. Hazel was a well respected and a valued member of T.A.R.G. as her enthusiasm for ham radio was infectious.

We offer our deepest sympathies to her loving husband Joe EI5GE and extended family. May she rest in peace.
