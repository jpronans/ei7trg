<div class="entry-content"><div class="entry-content">On Thursday 27th November 2013 last, members of the Tipperary Amateur Radio Group met at The Park Hotel in Clonmel at 8.30pm for their 20th Annual General Meeting. This was well attended with group members travelling from County Kilkenny, County Waterford, County Limerick and County Cork joining their County Tipperary based colleagues. Paul EI3ENB chaired this very productive meeting with John EI7IG reading the minutes from last years AGM. The group treasurer Thomas EI2IT reported a healthy financial situation for TARG which was formed in October 1994. A review of the year and the group activities was then discussed at length. Particular praise was given to Eddie EI3FFB for reading the weekly IRTS news every Sunday evening at 8.30pm on 145.450MHz FM and his efforts were very much appreciated. The new incoming committee was then elected and Denny O’Dwyer SWL was nominated as the Web Editor for the group website www.ei7trg.ie which was set up during the year. The venue for all group meetings in 2015 will continue to be held at The Park Hotel, Clonmel, County Tipperary. The meeting concluded at 11.30pm when Paul EI3ENB thanked all for their input and efforts in attending this most important event of the calendar year for TARG. The new committee was elected as follows: – - Chairman – Hugh O’Donnell EI2HI
- Vice Chairman – Eddie Kavanagh EI3FFB
- Secretary – John Ronan EI7IG
- Treasurer – Thomas Hallinan EI2IT
- Group PRO – Paul Norris EI3ENB
