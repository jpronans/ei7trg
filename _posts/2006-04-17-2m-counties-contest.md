We hope everyone had as much fun as TARG members had today in participating in the contest, many thanks to EI2IT, EI3ENB and EI7IG for operating in quite cool conditions at the top of Slievenamban. Good luck to all that participated and Happy Easter! After several years absence, TARG returned to the top of Slievenamban for the counties contest. Though cold, it was good fun, and to paraphrase the immortal words of Arnie, "We'll be back". Many thanks to Jim Ronan for working on getting the Argo 8x8 mountain-worthy. ![pic2.JPG](http://www.ei7trg.org/archives/mtstatic/images/pic2.JPG)Hmmm, will this hold? ![pic1.jpg](http://www.ei7trg.org/archives/mtstatic/images/pic1.jpg)I can't find it, lads, Lads?
