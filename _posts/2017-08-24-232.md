<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode"><div dir="ltr">Tipperary Amateur Radio Group visited [Ballinacourty Lighthouse](http://www.irishlights.ie/tourism/our-lighthouses/ballinacourty-point.aspx), Co. Waterford last weekend for the 20th annual [ILLW](https://illw.net/) event. The club operated 2 stations on both SSB and CW. The members who attended were Paul EI3ENB, Andy EI5JF, John EI7IG, Hugh EI2HI and Ronan EI4KN. Despite challenging conditions during the setup of the station the club members enjoyed a good weekend getting many [QSO's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code) in the log. Andy, EI5JF produced the video below, as well as taking some [pictures](http://www.andyjayphoto.com/TARG-EI7T-IE0018-Lighthouse-Operation/i-fHV5Lcg/A) at the site.
