The next meeting of the Tipperary Amateur Radio Group will be held at Cahir House Hotel, Cahir, Co Tipperary on Tuesday the 22nd of March 2016 at 8.00pm. There will be a presentation made at this meeting by Olivier ON4EI/EI8GQB on the use of green energy to power his contest station EI1A. IRTS President Ger EI8CC will also attend this meeting which is open to all and Short Wave Listeners are in particular very welcome. A number of radio related topics are up for discussion along with the Groups participation in upcoming events. Best of luck to Olivier in the ARRL SSB Contest this coming weekend. Conditions are not the best for setting up a portable contest station at the moment. Keep up to date with the goings on at EI1A by keeping an eye on his QRZ page[ here.](http://www.qrz.com/db/EI8GQB)
