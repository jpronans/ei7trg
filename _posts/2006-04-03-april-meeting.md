As the club had a meeting last week, and quite a few were present at the Galtee Walking Festival, the Committee has decided to postpone the April meeting until later in the month. The club has been asked if we could provide voice communications for the [Ballyhoura](http://www.ballyhourabears.com/) Walking Festival. We will most likely have a meeting closer to the date (last weekend in April) to organise ourselves for this event.
