On the 9th April three members of Tipperary Amateur Radio Group staged a field event to participate in the [IRTS 2m Counties Contest](http://www.irts.ie/cgi/showrules.cgi?2m) under their callsign EI7T. Our original plan was to take the [Argo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/13372578@N00/207967098/in/set-72157594226179951/) out of hibernation and go up [Slievenamon](http://mountainviews.ie/mv/index.php?mtnindex=95), but unluckily for us, the heather was being burned off the mountain all weekend, so we didn't fancy calling CQ from an inferno. So Plan B was to go to an elevated site at Tommy's QTH.

Two of the three of us forgot our 'nosebag' so we didn't delay packing up and getting on our way, despite a scare of missing car keys (7IG's) for a period, we were gone after 45 minutes.
