Persuaded the XYL and her sister to go walking yesterday, and took the opportunity to excercise the [Conterra-inc Radio Harness](http://www.conterra-inc.com/product_info.php?products_id=17). We walked up to the top of Suí Finn (Seefin) in the Monavullagh mountains. I managed to raise EI2IT, EI5JF and M3MEL (Cornwall) on simplex from the cairn on the top, and EI1CN on the [SEARG](http://www.searg.com) repeater system.
