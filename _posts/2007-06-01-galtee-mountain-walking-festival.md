Tipperary Amateur Radio Group, along with members of [AREN](http://www.aren.ie/home.html) are providing communication assistance over the Galty Walking Festival weekend, beginning tomorrow June 2nd. If you're at a loose end over the weekend and feel you could have something to contribute, please listen out/call on our simplex frequency 145.450. TARG/AREN has been officially thanked for our participation by the walks' organising commitee. The event will also be the initial field trial of the [GAISS](http://www.tssg.org/archives/2007/03/gaiss.html) project, so a very interesting weekend is in store. If you're coming to the walk and you have some spare radio equipment/antennas sitting there, bring it! It's better to be looking at it, than looking for it! Hope to see you all there - Registration at "The Foot" bar at 9am, but we'll be setting up radios etc some time before that - tune to 145.450, this will be monitored. Â
