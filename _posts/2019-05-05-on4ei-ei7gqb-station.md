In March, Olivier Vandenbalck, ON4EI, was active for the [CQ World Wide WPX SSB Contest](https://www.cqwpx.com/). He operated from a temporary station which he sets up on a hill in Tipperary. While he was there, various club members visited to assist with the putting together of the station. During a break in the work, Andy, EI5JF was able to get some video footage of the station.
