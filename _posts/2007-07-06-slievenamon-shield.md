It was great to see so many at a meeting last night. Considering the terrible weather it was very impressive. Good luck to those operating for the VHF/UHF Field Day this weekend, and we would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone to submit logs of your 70cms contacts during the month of July for the Slievenamon Shield. ![Slievenamon Shield](http://www.irts.ie/images/trophies/21trophy.jpg "Slievenamon Shield")
