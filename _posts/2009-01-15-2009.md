2009 has arrived, almost unexpectedly. TARG had a most enjoyable night out just before Christmas, even though we were missing some members. We wish everyone a safe and peaceful 2009, and hope to see you all at some stage during the year. Last week we had our first meeting of 2009. Discussion ranged from the Elecraft K3 that one member brought for inspection, to diagnosing a fault with a digital mode station (belonging to EI3ENB), to the imminent arrival of new QSL cards, and,of course, to looking forward to events in 2009. See you on the air!
