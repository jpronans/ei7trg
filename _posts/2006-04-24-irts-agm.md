Most of the Committee were present at the IRTS AGM this year. Paul, EI3ENB ventured down to Cork Saturday evening, EI7IG, EI2IT and EI3FFB departed their various homes to arrive in time for 'kick-off'. EI2HI arrived afterwards, just in time to collect the [Sliabh na mBan](http://www.ballymunkickhams.com/Sliabh_Na_mBan.html) (Slievenmon) Shield, again!. EI7IG collected the Shandon Trophy on behalf of TARG, for the Clubs efforts in the VHF/UHF Field day last July, and (a surprised) EI7IG also collected the Shiela Piper Cup. A most enjoyable day was had by all. ![2006AGMTrophy.jpg](http://www.ei7trg.org/archives/mtstatic/images/2006AGMTrophy.jpg)EI7IG, collecting the Shandon Trophy. ![2006AGMTalking.jpg](http://www.ei7trg.org/archives/mtstatic/images/2006AGMTalking.jpg)EI2IT, EI7IG and EI3FFB, relaxing in the sun.
