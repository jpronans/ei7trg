Wednesday 19th April last the Tipperary Amateur Radio Group held its AGM at the [Talbot Hotel Clonmel](https://www.talbothotelclonmel.ie/) (Previously the Park Hotel). The meeting was well attended with members visitors traveling from neighboring counties. Chairman Andy EI5JF welcomed new members in particular and opened the meeting. The minutes from the previous AGM were read and approved. Club treasurer Tommy EI2IT presented the financial status of the club which was in healthy order. A number of administrative items were dealt with and ratified. The committee for the forthcoming year was elected which was as follows:

- EI5JF - Andy Jay - Chair
- EI2JKB - Brian Kelly - Vice Chair
- EI7IG - John Ronan - Secretary
- EI3ENB - Paul Norris - QSL Manager
- EI2IT - Thomas Hallinan - Treasurer

The Club look forward to meeting old friends and new at the IRTS AGM/Rally weekend.
